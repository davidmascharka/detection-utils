Common functionality for object detection

This repository hosts functions that are commonly used across object detection projects. The
functionality here includes:

- [Box overlap computation](src/detection_utils/boxes.py#L29) (IoU)
- [Precision](src/detection_utils/metrics.py#L27) and [recall](src/detection_utils/metrics.py#L93) calculations
- [Computing targets](src/detection_utils/boxes.py#L82) for training a detector given a set of ground-truth objects
- [Non-maximum suppression](src/detection_utils/boxes.py#L170)
- [Coordinate transform utilities](src/detection_utils/boxes.py#L241)
- [Focal loss in PyTorch](src/detection_utils/pytorch.py#L26)

All the functions here are
[well-tested](tests) to ensure proper
functionality of these utilities. This repository is meant to ensure that modifications and improvements that are
implemented as part of one program migrate to other programs when appropriate.

## Installation

To use `detection-utils` you will need `numpy`, `numba`, and optionally `pytorch`. We recommend either fetching `numpy`
from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) or ensuring you can link against MKL yourself for
performance. You can install `numba` via pip and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) should be installed
according to your needs. For example:

``` shell
$ conda install numpy
$ pip install numba torch torchvision
```

#### Pip

`detection-utils` is availabe on PyPI: install via

``` shell
$ pip install detection-utils
```

#### Git
Clone this repository and install:

``` shell
$ git clone https://github.com/davidmascharka/detection-utils.git && cd detection-utils
$ pip install .
```

#### Verifying Installation

To verify installation, ensure that [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) and
[hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) are installed, then run
`pytest` from the `detection-utils` base directory.
